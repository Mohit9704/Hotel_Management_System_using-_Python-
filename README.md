# Hotel_Management_System_using_Python

I have tried to computerize the HOTEL-MANGEMENT system through this project. This project gives information regarding the check-in, check-out and booking facilities of the customer. The project is written in Python 3 that uses OOPS concept i.e based on object and classes.

THE NORMAL CODE IS NAMED AS MAIN.PY

TO RUN THE GUI JUST EXECUTE MAINLY.PY
